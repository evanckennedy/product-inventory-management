## Note on Aesthetics

For this project, the primary focus was on demonstrating the functionality of an ASP.NET Core MVC web application, specifically in the context of product and inventory management. As such, minimal effort was invested in the aesthetic aspects, such as CSS styling and layout design. The application's user interface is basic and primarily serves to showcase the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, along with inventory management functionalities. This approach allows for a concentrated demonstration of ASP.NET Core MVC capabilities without visual design.
